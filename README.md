This project is all about creating and testing a YOLOV8 model for detecting vehciles and traffic lights in CARLA simulator. 
The datasets are craeted from the real world as well as the simulated environment. The preprocessing steps including labelling annoting and augmenting are done using Roboflow and the training is done using Google Colab. The trained model is then integrated with CARLA environment to test the real time detection.
